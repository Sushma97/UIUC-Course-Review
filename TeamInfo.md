## Project Summary
This is a centralized review app for courses, professors, and departments at UIUC. This project aims to allow students to provide reviews for classes they’ve taken which will include a written review as well as other descriptors including a rating out of 5 stars, the professor they took the course with, the grade they got, and details like the average and maximum hours the student spent on the class each week. Students can provide reviews for professors in a similar fashion and this information can be aggregated to create an overall rating and summary for different departments. 
This will allow students to better understand the experience of a particular class, professor, or department to help them make a more educated decision on which classes to take in the future. The website could even provide recommendations for students based on the courses they’ve reviewed and their corresponding ratings.
