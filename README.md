# CS 411: Database Systems Spring 2022 UIUC Course Review 

## Project Description 
For students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, we designed a web application that assists students in searching for course information. This project is intended to be a resource for students who would like additional assistance in choosing a course, professor, and other basic information regarding classes. We used a Python web scraping script to collect and parse data pertinent to our project. This parsed data is stored in a MySQL database, which was created from scratch for this project. The MySQL instance was set up via the Google Cloud Platform. Students can leave a new review, read previous students' reviews, edit their own reviews, and delete their old reviews.
